 
# Datatypes.
- Everything inside a "Double quotes" is a = **[[10 STRING & TEMPLATE LITERALS|string]]**
-  A number/integer Doesn't need double quotes. 
- A [[11 BOOLEAN LOGIC|Boolean]] only gives **true** or **false** as output.

# Variables
- [[03 CONST|Const]] var is used to declare and store a value.
- It cannot be changed later.
- Always a statement ends with a semicolon.

- [[02 LET|let]] is used to store data

- Because the Java script is a [[01 SCRIPTING LANGUAGE|scripting languge]]
- Code executes step by step.

# Add variables
- We can add two strings
- we can add two int's or (int and a string) which i already did above.
- Javascript is a [[03 DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE|Dynamically typed language]] 
- It does [[05 TYPE COERCION| type coercion]] using javascript [[03 V8 ENGINE|v8 Engine]] following [[02 ECMA SCRIPT|ECMA rules]]
- No compilation. On the fly execution.
- *"string + string" = concatenation*
- *"string" + int = It will convert the int to "string" and Concatenate.*
- *int + int = Mathematical operation.*

# Arrays or (lists in other programming lang's)

- Using [[06 ARRAYS|arrays or lists]] we can store many values.
- It stores in a data in a "index/value" pair.

### Array in an Array (same code block.)

# OBJECT 
- [[02 OBJECT CLASS|Objects]] contains key/value pairs.
- In [[06 ARRAYS|arrays]] index/key values the index is already defined. {0....n}

# For loop
- [[03 FOR LOOP|for loop]] checks every time if the condition applies. If soo it will execute {...}
